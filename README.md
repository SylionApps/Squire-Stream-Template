## Overview
[Streams](http://squireapp.com/features#streams) is a [Squire](http://www.squireapp.com) feature that lets the user watch content available outside of their hard drive. This means a stream is an ordered collection of items that can be watched in Squire. Each stream is encapsulated in an ```stm``` file. ```stm``` files are added to the Squire Helper which then extracts, orders and organizes the contents for the stream so they can be enjoyed from any available Squire client.

## Installation
Download [eztv-720p-shows.zip](https://github.com/iharosi/Squire-Stream-Template/releases/download/v0.1.0/eztv-720p-shows.zip), unzip it and double click on the .stm file (eztv-720p-shows.stm on this case). The stream will be added automatically to Squire Helper. After a few seconds, the stream’s content will be available on “Shows” section on Squire.app.

## Recommendations
I do recommend to sort Movies by Popular filter. To do this open Squire.app and press down key to access filter list.

## Support
If you are experiencing problems please open a new Issue, so I can take a look.
